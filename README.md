## Snake3D

Snake3D is a classic game implementation of Snake in a 3D environment. The game is built using JavaScript and the Three.js library, bringing a new twist to the traditional Snake gameplay.

### Gameplay

In Snake3D, you control a snake represented by a chain of interconnected cubes within a three-dimensional playing field. Your objective is to maneuver the snake around the 3D environment, consuming food to grow in length and score points.

The snake can be controlled using the keyboard's directional keys. Be careful not to collide with the obstacles of the playing field or your own body, as doing so will end the game. As you progress and the snake grows, the challenge increases, requiring strategic thinking and quick reflexes to avoid collisions.
